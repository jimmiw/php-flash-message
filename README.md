Did you ever want a way to display messages from an update, to a view?
Do you redirect the user away from the update location?

I've tried to make a small script that helps you do that, but it has a few assumptions in it.

### How does it work? ###

In order to get the script a test, you simply need to include the source file for it. Then you need to call the *flash(*label,message*)* function.
